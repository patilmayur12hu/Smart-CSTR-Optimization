1. Abstract

This project focuses on optimizing a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) performing an esterification reaction using Industry 4.0 technologies. Through IoT sensor simulation, AI/ML prediction models, and a digital twin approach, this study enhances conversion efficiency under varying temperature and flow conditions. Results are visualized using a smart dashboard that includes real-time predictive control logic. The goal is to showcase how modern technologies can smartly control and optimize chemical processes remotely and efficiently.

2. Introduction to Industry 4.0 in Chemical Engineering

Industry 4.0 integrates digital and smart technologies like IoT, AI, cloud computing, and data analytics into traditional chemical processes. In chemical engineering, these technologies help monitor, predict, and optimize process parameters in real-time, enabling autonomous decision-making, remote control, and smart optimization of reactors like CSTRs.

3. Process Description: CSTR + Esterification Reaction

A CSTR is a type of reactor where reactants are continuously stirred and maintained at steady state. This project uses a simulated esterification reaction between acetic acid and ethanol forming ethyl acetate and water:

CH₃COOH + C₂H₅OH ⇌ CH₃COOC₂H₅ + H₂O

The conversion efficiency is mainly influenced by temperature and flow rate, which are optimized using ML techniques.

4. IoT Simulation Framework

Sensors Simulated: Temperature, flow rate, pH, pressure.

Platform: Python used to simulate live-like sensor data.

Connectivity: MQTT/Wi-Fi-like simulation to imitate cloud data flow.

Microcontroller: (Simulated) Arduino or Raspberry Pi.


5. Machine Learning Model

Model Type: Random Forest or Neural Network.

Inputs: Flow rate (L/min) and Temperature (°C).

Output: Predicted Conversion Efficiency (%).

Training Data: Simulated using known chemical behavior.

Evaluation Metrics: R², MAE, RMSE.

Code Files: model_training.py trains and validates the model.

6. Results & Discussion

Plot 1: Temperature vs Conversion → Optimal range identified around 70–80°C.

Plot 2: Flow Rate vs Conversion → Lower flow rate improves conversion due to longer residence time.

Plot 3: 3D Surface Plot of Temp vs Flow vs Conversion.

Dashboard: Interactive UI shows predictions and trends using Plotly Dash.

Digital Twin: MATLAB/Simulink model compares real-time vs predicted behavior.

7. Conclusion & Future Work

The integration of IoT, ML, and digital twin technology into a CSTR-based esterification reaction enables real-time optimization and smarter control of the process. Future enhancements include actual sensor hardware and edge computing deployment. Integration with cloud platforms like AWS or Azure can also be implemented.
